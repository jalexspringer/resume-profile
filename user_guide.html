<h1 id="alex-springers-user-guide">Alex Springer’s User Guide</h1>
<p>Welcome to my User Guide to working with me. The faster we get to know each other and how we work, the better and stronger our relationship will be, and the more we’ll accomplish together. I encourage you to write your own User Guide so I and your team can learn how to work best with you. This is a living document that will change and evolve as I learn more about myself and how we can best support each other.</p>
<p>A good starting point for this is the 16 personality/Myers-Briggs test. My results (and free to take test) here: <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/e012c8744b76a" class="uri">https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/e012c8744b76a</a></p>
<p>Note: This borrows heavily from a few different user guides from executives I admire. Thank you for the inspiration!</p>
<h2 id="my-approach">My approach</h2>
<p>I take my work very seriously and put a lot of time and energy into it. I’m passionate about developing myself, my team, and our office as a whole to help us realise success in our markets, promote a culture of challenge, openness, and accountability that is 100% focused on the success of our customers.</p>
<p>I always assume we’re not doing things the best way possible and am therefore always looking to question, iterate, and try new things to work more effectively and successfully. I value learning as much as results. A project that doesn’t work but teaches us something is as important as individual wins - as long as we acknowledge when something isn’t working and quickly abandon it.</p>
<p>Let’s find ways to automate or delegate or not do many of the things we’re doing now in order to make sure we are doing high-value work. I will challenge your processes where I see inefficiency - I do this because I trust you and want to see you succeed and I expect the same challenges to my way of thinking/working.</p>
<p>I am generally a realist with a tendency towards excitability when it comes to large projects, interesting clients, and big changes. Don’t mistake this for being wedded to an idea - I can turn off of an initiative as quickly as I turn on if it doesn’t pan out and I am always open to hearing the reasons an idea won’t work. If you disagree with me tell me, no matter how passionate I am about the topic.</p>
<p>I love working with people with a good attitude. I prefer people who focus aggressively on the things that they can control and deprioritise the things they can’t. There is a very important balance between staying in your lane and pointing out and fixing problems - let’s make sure we continue to work on this balance together.</p>
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p>The vast majority of issues are a result of poor or infrequent communication. My hierarchy of communication (most to least urgent): Call -&gt; Slack (Whatsapp after-hours) -&gt; Email.</p>
<p>I will always make myself available if you need me. I know that my diary is difficult to find space in and I apologise in advance for the number of times our 1:1 time will move during the week. Do not feel like you need to wait or are imposing by coming to me directly with issues when they need to be addressed. If you have not heard either an answer or a next step to getting an answer from me on the same day about a question please chase me.</p>
<p>I don’t expect you to respond/complete everything immediately but I do expect you to close the loop on everything we open. If it is on my plate I will do the same.</p>
<p>I have a tendency to think and process in real time and will generally be ready to give feedback and start analysing calls/meetings/events as soon as they occur. I recognise that this is not the case for everybody and if you work better by taking time to review and order your thoughts let me know and I will work to respect that. There will be times I get carried away and forget this - please check me when I do so.</p>
<h2 id="s">1:1s</h2>
<p>Use our running Google Doc throughout the week to add non-time sensitive points that we need to speak about during our 1:1s. This helps fight the tendency to just talk about the three things that happened just before the actual 1:1.</p>
<p>I do not find it to be a valuable use of 1:1 time to talk about quota attainment. As a customer centric sales team our focus is on what is best for each individual customer and how to best work each deal individually. See the Customer Centric Sales document for more detail.</p>
<p>During each 1:1 we will talk about two things in addition to any points added to the 1:1 doc - stuck deals/timings, and prospecting efforts. Pipeline cover is a very, very general metric to be taken with a huge grain of salt - let’s make sure we are structuring your prospecting efforts to promote a sustainable long term growth in your assigned verticals/accounts rather than focusing on arbitrary numbers.</p>
<p>As our team grows and we move towards more pro-active processes I will be working with you to understand how your time is allocated. Some weeks will have more current deal activity and some will have more time for outreach and prospecting, but let’s make sure we understand the priority of each task, how your days are best structured, and put processes in place to measure the results of these tasks.</p>
<p>We will write Business Plans as a team bi-annually, quickly review our actions and results monthly, and look at strategies and goals quarterly. These plans are incredibly useful if we make them so - the second that we look at them as a static process and a pain in the ass it is time to change the way we approach them. As in everything - commit to being honest and innovative in these plans.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-work">How I work</h2>
<p>I’m available to you any time day or night. If something is urgent please call me. If I’m not answering it’s because I’m running from meeting to meeting and losing track. Please put something in my diary.</p>
<p>I understand and respect your work and personal schedule and I want you to work where and when you feel you can be most effective given your own circumstances and energy. If you’re more productive doing certain activities in a coffee shop do it there. If you need to be in the office for a meeting or to create connections internally then be in the office. You are in charge of your own work schedule. Please don’t abuse this flexibility.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-from-me-to-you">Feedback from me to you</h2>
<p>I get caught up in the work we’re doing and the results we are chasing and if you are on my team it is because I trust that you are focused on the same results. I will work from this assumption until proven otherwise.</p>
<p>There are two primary things that will shake this trust: dishonesty, and a lack of clarity in communication that may unintentionally come off as dishonest. If you don’t know something, tell me you don’t know. We are disrupting an industry and always pushing forward - so it is a fair assumption that there is always more that we do not know than there is that we know. We are on this journey together and will waste a lot of time if we misrepresent what we know to each other. If we are dishonest with each other our relationships will fail quickly and we won’t be able to work with each - this includes omission of important information. Related to this - if we are agreeing on everything it is likely we are not telling one another the truth.</p>
<p>Because I am extremely passionate about our team and the work we are doing as well as very curious and happy to question anything and everything, I may come off as combative and agree or disagree with you vehemently. In the case where this rubs you the wrong way (which will inevitably happen), it will be because:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I’m so excited by the substance of our disagreement. This is ideal and a sign that our relationship is in a great place.</li>
<li>You did something I felt was poorly constructed, incomplete, or otherwise not up to expectations. We all have triggers that cause us to look unfavorably on our colleagues - these are mine:
<ol type="1">
<li>Giving up too soon and not showing enough grit. I love to see people confront adversity with creativity and resilience.</li>
<li>You aren’t showing enough rigor - evaluate all the available evidence, integrate that information with data from other sources, and apply sound judgement from there.</li>
<li>You are not connecting your immediate work to your broader goals. It is important to regularly evaluate the relevance and value of a given process or behaviour.</li>
<li>You aren’t fostering collaboration or an upbeat environment. I love it when you know your strengths and weaknesses as well as those of others and use those to make the team stronger.</li>
<li>You are shirking responsibility. Own your own work - it’s OK to take calculated risks and fail. Speak out when something doesn’t work and pair that feedback with solutions.</li>
<li>You aren’t engaging in your own learning and teaching. Curiosity is important - about our industry, business, customers, role, and ourselves.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>I’m frustrated because you have done parts of (2) multiple times and as a result I have lost trust in you. If we’re here I will nitpick and micro-manage, which is not pleasant for either of us. My frustration will be exacerbated because I also know that this is my fault, not yours. We both made what we felt was the best decision that you, in this role, in this company was right. I (or someone at Impact) did reference checks and evaluated your track record and know that you are capable and talented and you did the same in your evaluation of us. If we get to this place it is because we are not a good match. I will take responsibility and we’ll either look for a more suitable match or work on an exit.</li>
<li>I’m not listening well. If true, I may realise later and apologise - particularly if you put down in writing what you were saying and I refer back and realise I was the dummy. I respect being called out on this.</li>
<li>I’m frustrated or scared about something unrelated to you and I’m taking it out on you. If this is the case I will apologise when I realise it later.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="feedback-from-you-to-me">Feedback from you to me</h2>
<p>Commit to providing me direct feedback when I’m blocking you or the company’s success.</p>
<p>I am flawed. I’m not great at process. I sometimes leap to conclusions, rally people around it, then backtrack. I can go into a hole when strategizing. I put together frameworks that I don’t hang on to for very long. I’m a workaholic and will work at odd hours. Sometimes I’m slow to fully grasp a new point or don’t listen well because I’m stuck on an idea. I can be over-analytical and slow to act on some opportunities and impulsive about other opportunities. I can be too long-winded. My list of flaws is longer as you will learn.</p>
<p>I try to hold myself to the same standards as I hold my team to, but I don’t always do this well. Sometimes it will feel like a double-standard where I expect you to be a certain way but I am not that way myself. I seek continual improvement and beat myself up about weaknesses, and I like it when my team helps make me better.</p>
<p>Giving feedback is difficult and giving feedback to your boss is extremely difficult. I understand this and I want to create a relationship where you are free to say anything that you are feeling and you are free to tell me when I’m screwing up or need to improve. This feedback is a gift from you to me that is difficult for you to give, which makes it all the more valuable. I want to make the commitment to my entire team to create the kind of relationship where we can be candid with one another and this takes work from both sides.</p>
<p>I consider it an obligation to help you make the most of your time here and to set you and the company up for success. I want to help you grow and flourish as much as possible, and if your priorities change I want to help set you up to move to an opportunity that is a better fit. Please be open with me about this.</p>
<p>HR will require certain development conversations but this should be a constant and open discussion between us. Don’t delegate your personal development to me - know where you’re going, make it a partnership. I am instinctively more of a coach than a teacher. Be clear with me on what you need or if you are not feeling fulfilled, as well as what you need on cash, equity, role, level, etc - you’ll get much further with me through transparency.</p>
<h2 id="management-style">Management style</h2>
<p>Outside of product and initial company/team training, I try to operate as a coach and not a trainer. The difference between training and coaching in sales comes down to empowerment of the individual. In sports, a coach stands on the field and calls out plays; a trainer outlines the specific moves in a play and then drills that play. And in sales, a coach empowers reps to figure out, with some guidance, the next best steps to success. A trainer, meanwhile, essentially says, ‘do this.’</p>
<p>I lean more towards hands-off management than micro-management. My high-level theory is that I try to hire superheroes that are going to figure out what needs to get done and will go get it done. When we aren’t hitting goals I will seek more information and transparency. There’s a see-saw dynamic here: good results means I need less information and transparency, poor results means I need more information and transparency. Understand this and use it to get ahead of my concerns.</p>
<p>I’ll generally let you decide how much detail I need. I prefer that you consider me your thought partner and you should provide me with enough detail to do that. For large initiatives/deals I will want all of the details so I can be sure I am best supporting you and the customer.</p>
<p>I want you to have full access to other leaders and executives. Don’t hesitate to go to them directly for things you need, though try to keep me in the loop at a high-level on what you’re working on with them.</p>
<p>I want you to have a ton of independence and access to other teams. If you find problems you are empowered to fix them but don’t go rogue. Make sure you’re always conscious of the impact on other teams and you’re using the right channels to resolve.</p>
<h2 id="final-points">Final Points</h2>
<p>If you’ve made it this far - thank you for taking the time! I know I can also be a bit wordy. Feedback is appreciated and please consider creating a user guide of your own - it by no means needs to be quite this long, and can always grow or shrink as you have time. I hope you find this exercise valuable both personally and professionally.</p>
