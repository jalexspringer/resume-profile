Client  focused  with  a  history  of  successful  sales,  operations,  and  technical contributions  and  leadership.  I  am  most  engaged  when speaking  directly  with  the  end  user  and  gaining  a  deep  understanding  of  their needs  and  challenges  and  working  towards  creating  the  solution  to  those  needs. I  bring  excellent  communication,  project  planning,  and  data-driven  decision making  to  the  teams  that  I  work  on  and  am  looking  for  a  position taking a consultative approach to helping clients increase efficiency and reduce time to delivery.
