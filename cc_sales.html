<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deeper understanding of the full buying process</li>
<li>Plan for and around surprises - know there will always be some!
<ul>
<li>Understand the buyer, use MEDDPICC, and get ahead of surprises</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trusted advisor to customer on not just the product but also the process that it takes to get it purchased</li>
<li>Accurate forecasting based on a mutually agreed plan between us and the customer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="our-focus---customer-success-and-growth">Our Focus - Customer Success and Growth</h2>
<ul>
<li>Always doing exactly what is right for our customers</li>
<li>Every conversation is about what the client needs, not our company or quota needs</li>
<li>Quota attainment is the measure of the success of this approach, not the end itself. Our customers don’t care about our quotas</li>
<li>Individual account engagements are all unique and proceed at a pace set by both us and the client, unrelated to our artificially imposed quarters</li>
<li>No surprises - ask every question, know the pitfalls. See ‘Discovery’ below.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="qualification">Qualification</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most important question: is our solution what the customer needs to grow and be successful?</li>
<li>Budget, timing, ability are important but secondary, because…</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="building-trust">Building Trust</h2>
<ul>
<li>All proceeds on the goal of helping the customer get the solution that they need in place. If that need is for Impact, move forward. If it isn’t, move on.</li>
<li>We do this all the time - the customer doesn’t. They benefit from our help in not just explaining the solution/product/USP/market problem, but also in setting the pace for a successful process</li>
<li>Customers need to trust us enough to tell us what they need, but also to know that we are not just doing this for our quarter</li>
<li>Actively listening, echoing what we have learned, tailoring messaging based on it, and showing how each of our steps add value is important</li>
<li>With every next step the question in our minds is - what moves this customer closer to their end goal - and since we know from qualification that what this customer needs is our product, the end goal is of course the sale and successful onboarding!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>
<ul>
<li>Partnerships related:
<ul>
<li>challenges in current program/processes</li>
<li>asks for future platform</li>
<li>KPIs and goals</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="owning-the-process">Owning the process</h2>
<ul>
<li>Confident and quick follow up is key - don’t ever leave the conversation hanging
<ul>
<li>A quick thank you note and a promise of more in depth follow up is fine</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be proactive about suggesting next steps
<ul>
<li>In the opening of the meeting, set the agenda and then say if we do all of this, what happens next?</li>
<li>‘Now that you’ve seen the platform, our advertisers often find it helpful to get an idea of migration effort and pricing.’</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Find out who needs to be involved every step of the way - make recommendations about who is an important stakeholder from our perspective.
<ul>
<li>’Who on your side is involved in the migration and/or commercial side and needs to be involved in that session?</li>
<li>Try to get tech involved early as well as DMs but make sure you don’t waste the DMs time without having your business case first.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be specific about times
<ul>
<li>‘Can we set something up for Tuesday or Wednesday next week?’</li>
<li>Instead of - ‘oh, let’s get something in the books in the next couple weeks’</li>
<li>Do this at the end of a call where possible instead of waiting for the follow up email - compare diaries while you are still front and center!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be upfront about challenges that you foresee and enlist the customer’s help in navigating them
<ul>
<li>‘As we approach summer time we often find that holidays can delay the legal or commercial process - are there any individual schedules that we should be mindful of working around here?’</li>
<li>’Often our clients have concerns about the amount of effort involved in a migration and the potential risk to revenue involved. We’ve helped migrate hundreds of programs with no loss of revenue - can we dig in further to get a better understanding of your publisher mix and work with you and your team to scope a successful migration?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to ask questions, as long as they clearly demonstrate a client focus</li>
<li>It’s about what they need, not what we need</li>
<li>Always be looking for the surprises that we know are there</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keep-up-the-pace">Keep up the pace</h2>
<ul>
<li>Diligence, transparency, and ownership leads to professional interactions</li>
<li>Deliver timely responses, with considered and relevant information</li>
<li>Echo what we have learned in the most recent conversations, good or bad
<ul>
<li>‘Thank you for your time! I understand that the ability to accurately report on the true cost of the program has been a challenge, and in addition to the reporting we talked about today, here are a few additional resources for your consideration:’</li>
<li>‘It seems like there are still concerns around our pricing model that we need to clear up. I want to make sure we set up this partnership for success - can you tell me a bit more about your ideal pricing structure and how it might better enable growth for your program?’</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Respect the timings of the customer - but make sure we know them in the first place and understand the why behind them</li>
</ul>
