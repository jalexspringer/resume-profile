## Hello!

I am a sales and operations leader supporting pre- and post- sales teams in selling and implementing a complex marketing SaaS technology. I work closely with executive, technical, and marketing teams from enterprise companies like American Express, Airbnb, eBay, and Walmart to understand their needs, concerns, and gather technical requirements in order to deliver comprehensive implementation solutions and project plans. In my role as a manager I work to improve our sales and onboarding processes, develop strategies to decrease time to close, launch, and success and increase client satisfaction, while working on continuous education for both my direct team members and the company as a whole. 

My approach to sales and solutions design comes from my background as a solutions architect, but also from my background in the hospitality and theatre businesses. I believe that being truly customer centric drives real results, and I maintain that all everyone in an organisation, including the sales teams, are customer success teams - the only difference between prospect and customer is time! You can see the details of this approach here: [Customer Centric Sales Process](https://jalexspringer.github.io/cc_sales.md)

In addition to the direct responsibilities of my work today I also develop and maintain tools for our teams to increase efficiency. I am fascinated by back-end and infrastructure work and love finding ways to automate testing, development, and configuration to streamline the way we work and I believe that this applies to sales as much as any other part of a business. In my spare time I study and work hands-on with AWS, GCP, and Linux and have obtained a Linux Systems Administrator Certification (Linux Foundation) and AWS Solutions Architect Certification (Associate with plans for Professional this year).

I have the knowledge, aptitude, and desire to ramp quickly and deliver excellent results for both the business and - most importantly - our clients. 

I look forward to continuing the conversation! 

- Alex Springer


P.S. If you really want to get to know about how I work (and have a bit of time on your hands) you can see my ['user guide' here.](https:/jalexspringer.github.io/user_guide.md) I share this with my teams and with any potential new hire at a later stage in the interview process.
