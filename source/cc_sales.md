# Customer centric sales process
This document was created by [Alex Springer](https://jalexspringer.github.io) and regularly
hacked/modified/toyed with as specific needs evolve. Feel free to take it and modify for
your own organisation.

## Goal
- Deeper understanding of the full buying process
- Plan for and around surprises - know there will always be some!
  - Understand the buyer, use MEDDPICC, and get ahead of surprises
- Trusted advisor to customer on not just the product but also the process that it takes to get it purchased
- Accurate forecasting based on a mutually agreed plan between us and the customer

## Our Focus - Customer Success and Growth
- Always doing exactly what is right for our customers
- Every conversation is about what the client needs, not our company or quota needs
- Quota attainment is the measure of the success of this approach, not the end itself. Our customers don’t care about our quotas
- Individual account engagements are all unique and proceed at a pace set by both us and the client, unrelated to our artificially imposed quarters
- No surprises - ask every question, know the pitfalls. See ‘Discovery’ below.

## Qualification
- Most important question: is our solution what the customer needs to grow and be successful?
- Budget, timing, ability are important but secondary, because...

## Building Trust
- All proceeds on the goal of helping the customer get the solution that they need in place. If that need is for Impact, move forward. If it isn’t, move on.
- We do this all the time - the customer doesn’t. They benefit from our help in not just explaining the solution/product/USP/market problem, but also in setting the pace for a successful process
- Customers need to trust us enough to tell us what they need, but also to know that we are not just doing this for our quarter
- Actively listening, echoing what we have learned, tailoring messaging based on it, and showing how each of our steps add value is important
- With every next step the question in our minds is - what moves this customer closer to their end goal - and since we know from qualification that what this customer needs is our product, the end goal is of course the sale and successful onboarding!

## Discovery
- Partnerships related:
    - challenges in current program/processes
    - asks for future platform
    - KPIs and goals
- Business related:
    - Stakeholders (and the competing asks on their time - responsibilities, holidays, etc)
    - Decision maker, signatory, gate keepers (security, procurement, legal, etc.)
    - Internal timelines
    - Decision making timeline
    - Standard legal and security review timelines
    - Code freezes
    - Budget/business cycles
    - Broader business focuses

## Owning the process
- Confident and quick follow up is key - don’t ever leave the conversation hanging
    - A quick thank you note and a promise of more in depth follow up is fine
- Be proactive about suggesting next steps
    - In the opening of the meeting, set the agenda and then say if we do all of this, what happens next?
    - 'Now that you’ve seen the platform, our advertisers often find it helpful to get an idea of migration effort and pricing.’
- Find out who needs to be involved every step of the way - make recommendations about who is an important stakeholder from our perspective.
    - 'Who on your side is involved in the migration and/or commercial side and needs to be involved in that session?
    - Try to get tech involved early as well as DMs but make sure you don’t waste the DMs time without having your business case first.
- Be specific about times
    - ‘Can we set something up for Tuesday or Wednesday next week?’
    - Instead of - ‘oh, let’s get something in the books in the next couple weeks’
    - Do this at the end of a call where possible instead of waiting for the follow up email - compare diaries while you are still front and center!
- Be upfront about challenges that you foresee and enlist the customer’s help in navigating them
    - 'As we approach summer time we often find that holidays can delay the legal or commercial process - are there any individual schedules that we should be mindful of working around here?’
    - 'Often our clients have concerns about the amount of effort involved in a migration and the potential risk to revenue involved. We've helped migrate hundreds of programs with no loss of revenue - can we dig in further to get a better understanding of your publisher mix and work with you and your team to scope a successful migration?
- Don’t be afraid to ask questions, as long as they clearly demonstrate a client focus
- It’s about what they need, not what we need
- Always be looking for the surprises that we know are there

## Keep up the pace
- Diligence, transparency, and ownership leads to professional interactions
- Deliver timely responses, with considered and relevant information
- Echo what we have learned in the most recent conversations, good or bad
    - 'Thank you for your time! I understand that the ability to accurately report on the true cost of the program has been a challenge, and in addition to the reporting we talked about today, here are a few additional resources for your consideration:’
    - 'It seems like there are still concerns around our pricing model that we need to clear up. I want to make sure we set up this partnership for success - can you tell me a bit more about your ideal pricing structure and how it might better enable growth for your program?’
- Respect the timings of the customer - but make sure we know them in the first place and understand the why behind them
